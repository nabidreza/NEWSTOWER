	<h1>Thursday briefing: Signs the omicron surge may be slowing; dropping college enrollment; weekend winter weather; and more</h1>

	<h2>1.The omicron surge may be slowing in some U.S. cities.</h2>

<p><b>There are promising signs</b> in New York City, Boston and Philadelphia, although it’s too early to say there’s a rapid decline.</p>
<p><b>What this means:</b> Parts of the country could be near a turning point in the latest coronavirus wave.</p>
<p><b>Coming today:</b> President Biden will announce that he’s sending medical teams to six states — New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Rhode Island, Michigan and New Mexico ― to help struggling hospitals.</p>

	<h2>2.2021 had the highest inflation in 40 years.</h2>

<p><b>Why?</b> Backed-up supply chains, combined with high demand from shoppers, raised prices.</p>
<p><b>How long will this last?</b> There's no way to know, but officials expect prices will continue to go up this year.</p>
<p><b>What got more expensive:</b> Every category of food, gas (up 50% in the past year), home prices and rent, as well as health care, to name a few.</p>


	<h2>3.College enrollment in the U.S. dropped again last fall.</h2>

<p><b>The numbers:</b> There were 465,300 fewer students compared with the year before, according to a new report.
<p><b>The big picture:</b> More than 1 million students have gone missing from higher education since the start of the pandemic.</p>
<p><b>What’s causing this?</b> Some students may be questioning the value of college, especially with a record job market. But experts worry it could become a damaging economic trend.</p>

	<h2>4.Another winter storm will hit the central and Eastern U.S.</h2>

<p><b>Expect two phases:</b> The first dumping nearly a foot of snow over parts of the Midwest tomorrow and Saturday; the second hitting the East Coast, possibly even bringing snowflakes to Birmingham, Ala., and Atlanta, on Sunday.</p>
<p><b>What we don’t know:</b> The exact path of the storm, which will affect who gets snow and who gets sleet, rain and ice.</p>
